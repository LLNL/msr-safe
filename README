The msr-safe.ko module is comprised of the following source files:

Makefile
msr_entry.c		Original MSR driver with added calls to batch and
			whitelist implementations.
msr_batch.[ch]		MSR batching implementation
msr_whitelist.[ch]	MSR Whitelist implementation
whitelists		Sample text whitelist that may be input to msr_safe

Configuration notes after install:

Set up permissions and groups for /dev/cpu/#/msr_safe as you like since white
list will protect you from harm.

Sample white lists for each architecture are provided in whitelists directory.

To configure whitelist (as root):
	cat whitelist/wl_file > /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

To enumerate current whitelist (as root):
	cat < /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

To remove whitelist (as root):
	echo > /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist
