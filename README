MSR-SAFE
========

The msr-safe.ko module is comprised of the following source files:

    Makefile
    msr_entry.c         Original MSR driver with added calls to batch and
                        whitelist implementations.
    msr_batch.[ch]      MSR batching implementation
    msr_whitelist.[ch]  MSR Whitelist implementation
    whitelists          Sample text whitelist that may be input to msr_safe

Kernel Build & Load
-------------------

Building the msr-safe.ko module can be done with the commands below. A
successful load of the msr-safe kernel module will have `msr_batch` and
`msr_whitelist` in `/dev/cpu`, and will have an `msr_safe` present under each
CPU directory in `/dev/cpu/*`.

    git clone https://github.com/LLNL/msr-safe
    cd msr-safe
    make
    insmod msr-safe.ko

Configuration Notes After Install
---------------------------------

Setup permissions and group ownership for `/dev/cpu/msr_batch`,
`/dev/cpu/msr_whitelist`, and `/dev/cpu/*/msr_safe` as you like since the
whitelist will protect you from harm.

Sample whitelists for specific architectures are provided in `whitelists/`
directory. These are meant to be a starting point, and should be used with
caution. Each site may add to, remove from, or modify the write masks in the
whitelist depending on specific needs.

To configure whitelist:

    cat whitelist/wl_file > /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

Where `wl_file` can be determined as follows:

    printf 'wl_%.2x%x\n' $(lscpu | grep "CPU family:" | awk -F: '{print $2}') $(lscpu | grep "Model:" | awk -F: '{print $2}')

To confirm successful whitelist configured:

    cat /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

To enumerate the current whitelist (i.e., implies whitelist was loaded
successfully):

    cat < /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

To remove whitelist (as root):

    echo > /dev/cpu/msr_whitelist

msrsave
-------

The msrsave utility provides a mechanism for saving and restoring MSR values
based on entries in the whitelist. To restore MSR values, the register must
have an appropriate writemask.
