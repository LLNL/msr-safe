Welcome to msr-safe, a kernel module that can be used to allow safe access to model-specific
registers in Intel processors.

INSTALLATION:
make

SETUP:
Once installed, the /dev/cpu/*/msr_safe files will be set up with only root allowed to read/write.
The mode bits are meant to be changed depending on the security needs per system. 

For example, one could make a group called "msr" and change the permissions to allow group access 
to the whitelisted msr_safe registers.

Notes:

The version can be found by using:
	cat /sys/class/smsr/version
The available MSRs for your system can be found by using:
	cat /sys/class/smsr/avail
