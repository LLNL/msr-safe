Version 0.5 alpha

csr_safe.c		Main driver. Userspace can interact with it using an ioctl.
csr_whitelist.[ch]	Puts the 'safe' in csr-safe.
whitelists		Sample text based whitelists that can be redirected into whitelist driver.

Installation is as easy as "make && sudo insmod csr-safe.ko". After that just load the correct 
whitelist with cat whitelists/<architecture> > /dev/cpu/csr_whitelist.

It is up to the administrator to set the permissions of csr_safe and csr_whitelist. Keep
in mind that this driver can potentially be used to access /dev/mem and csr's can be dangerous if
modified incorrectly. We suggest that only administrators have access to /dev/cpu/csr_whitelist.
