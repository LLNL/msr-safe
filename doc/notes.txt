/* 
 * I assume that no MSR on this list contains sensitive information.  Reads
 * will return the unmodified contents of the entire MSR.
 *
 * There are six cases for writes, several of which may exist within a single
 * MSR:
 *
 * a) Reserved					mask=0
 * b) Read-Only					mask=0
 * c) Read/Write, but read-only per policy	mask=0
 * d) Clear-Only, but read-only per policy	mask=0
 * e) Read/Write				mask=1
 * f) Clear-Only				mask=1
 *
 * Intel provides the following guidance:
 * "When loading a register, always load the reserved bits with the values 
 * indicated in the documentation, if any, or reload them with values previously 
 * read from the same register." (Section 1.3.2)
 *
 * Based on this, all writes will execute a read-modify-write sequence as
 * follows:
 *
 * 	existingval	<- rdmsr() & ~writemask
 * 	maskedval	<- userval & writemask
 * 			   wrmsr( maskedval | temp )
 *
 *
 * References are to the September 2013 edition of the Intel documentation.
 *
 * Values are for processor family 06 model 2D, "Intel Xeon Processor E5 Family
 * based on the Intel microarchitecture code name Sandy Bridge" (Table 35-1).
 *
 * Relevant tables are:
 * 	Page 35-102

 * 	Table 35-11 and Table 35-12 MSRs Suppored by Intel Processors based on Intel microarchitecture code name Sandy Bridge
 *
 * 	Page 35-121
 * 	Section 35.8.2 MSRs in Intel Xeon Processor E5 Family 
 * 	Table 35-14 Selected MSRs Supported by Intel Xeon Processors E5 Family
 *
 * 	Page 35-2
 * 	Section 35.1
 * 	Table 35-2 IA-32 Architectural MSRs
 *
 * Architectural information should only be used when indicated by tables 35-11, 35-12 and 35-14.
 *
 *	IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER		See section 17.13.  Restrict to RO.
 *	 Thread		RW (RO)		
 *	 0x00 0x00

 * 	 Thread		RW (RO)
 *
 *	PERFEVTSELn			See Section 18.2.2.2 (Architectural Perforamnce Monitoring
 *	 0-3 Thread	RW		Version 3 Facilities).  Bits 63:32 are reserved.  Note that bit
 *       4-7 Core       RW		17 enables counting Ring 0 events; we may want to restrict this.
 *       0xFFFFFFFF 0x0
 *	
 *	PERF_STATUS	RO		See Section 14.1.1.  Table 35-12 contains a duplicate 
 *	 Package			entry for this MSR.  Interpreting both, bits 0-15 are
 *	 0x0 0x0			the current performance value and 47:32 is the core 
 *					voltage: [37:32] * (float) 1/(2^13).  I have asked Intel
 *					for clarification.
 *	 
 *	PERF_CTL	RW (RMW)	Bits 15:0 are the target performance value and bit 
 *	 Thread				32 controls turbo mode (set high to disable).
 *	 0x0 0x1			Section 14.1.1 states "Applications and performance
 *					tools are not expected to use either IA32_PERF_CTL
 *					or IA32_PERF_STATUS and should treat both as reserved",
 *					but Section 14.3.2.2 states "System software can 
 *					temporarily disengage opportunistic processor performance
 *					operation by setting bit 32 of the IA32_PERF_CTL (0199H),
 *					using a read-modify-write sequence on the MSR."  
 *
