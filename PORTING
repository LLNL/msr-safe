msr_safe was developed on a Redhat derivative Sandy Bridge system.

Linux cab690 2.6.32-358.14.1.3chaos.ch5.1.1.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 7 13:06:43 PDT 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I then ported it to an Ubuntu Haswell system.

Linux haswell 3.8.0-29-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 13 19:40:39 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

This process was.... fraught.

1.  	Redhat expects kernel source code in 

		/usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`

		i.e.

		/usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-358.14.1.3chaos.ch5.1.1.x86_64

	Ubuntu unpacks kernel source in a slightly different location, e.g.,

		/usr/src/linux-source-3.8.0/linux-source-3.8.0
	
	(mind the duplicate directory name).

	On Ubuntu, solve via a symlink:

		/usr/src/kernels/3.8.0-29-generic -> ../linux-source-3.8.0/linux-source-3.8.0


2.	Add these symlinks to the Ubuntu kernel source directory.

		include/generated -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/include/generated
		include/config -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/include/config

3.	Add this symlink as well.

		Module.symvers -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/Module.symvers
		.config -> /usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-29-generic/.config

4.	Run "make scripts" in the linux source directory to create recordmcount.

5.	<asm/system.h> and <smp_lock.h> no longer exist in 3.x kernels.  Until we figure out
	a portable locking solution, we'll need to live without locking.

6.	Expected use requires only open, read and write (and close?).  ioctl and lseek do not
	need to be supported and that code has been removed.

7.	The following warning occurs under Ubuntu but not Redhat:

		msr_safe.c:328:21: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]

	We'll ignore it for now.
